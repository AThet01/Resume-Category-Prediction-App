Project Title:
Resume Category Prediction App

!! Still not getting app and still trying !!
!! Open Source if u want to try !!

Short Description:
A web application that predicts the category (e.g., job type or role) of a resume based on the content provided by the user.

Detailed Description:

This project involves the development of a Resume Category Prediction App, which allows users to upload resumes in PDF or text format. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the app categorizes the resume based on the content and provides predictions for the type of job role it is suited for (e.g., software engineer, data scientist, etc.).

Key Features:

Resume Upload: Users can upload resumes in either PDF or plain text format.

Text Extraction and Cleaning: The app extracts text from uploaded resumes, cleans it, and preprocesses the content for further analysis.

Text Vectorization: The app uses techniques like TF-IDF to convert resume content into numerical features for machine learning.

Category Prediction: The app uses a trained machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.) to predict the category of the resume based on the content.

User Interface: The app provides a simple and interactive interface built using Streamlit for easy interaction and display of results.

Error Handling: The app includes error handling for various edge cases like incorrect file formats or decoding issues.

Technologies Used:
Python: The main programming language for app development.
Streamlit: Used for building the web interface for users to interact with the app.
scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for model training and prediction.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A technique for transforming resume text into features that the machine learning model can process.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Used for cleaning and preprocessing the resume text (e.g., removing stop words, stemming).
Pandas & Numpy: Used for data manipulation and processing.
Joblib: Used for saving and loading the trained machine learning model.

Steps Involved:
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of resumes, ideally labeled by job categories.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the text, remove stop words, and apply text vectorization (TF-IDF).
Model Training: Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data to classify resumes into categories.
Deployment: Deploy the app using Streamlit to allow users to interact with the model and upload resumes for predictions.

Example Use Case:
A recruiter can upload a resume to the app, and it will predict whether the resume is suited for a "Data Scientist", "Software Engineer", or any other pre-defined role, helping recruiters sort resumes faster and more efficiently.

Future Improvements:
Model Improvement: Experiment with more advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT) to improve prediction accuracy.
Expanded Categories: Increase the number of categories (job roles) the app can predict.
Additional Features: Implement additional functionalities like resume ranking, matching to job descriptions, or providing feedback on resume quality.
